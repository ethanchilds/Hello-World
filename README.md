# Overview

This software is simple. It will print "Hello World" in the user console.

I am not creating this software to learn more about how to create software, but how to present it. As I progress in my career with software development I would like to be able to proudly display my work. To do so I must first learn how to create and display such work. This software is a chance that I mean to give me experience in this facet of my career.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

To develop this software I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE and to upload my repository I made use of Git Bash.

The language used for this program was Python

As this was not a difficult software to develop, I did not use outside sources, but I will include the video
that taught me how to code in the first place:

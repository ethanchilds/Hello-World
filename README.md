# Overview

This software is simple. It will print "Hello World" in the user console.

I am not creating this software to learn more about how to create software, but how to present it. As I progress in my career with software development I would like to be able to proudly display my work. To do so I must first learn how to create and display such work. This software is a chance that I mean to give me experience in this facet of my career.

Below a link to a video overview of this program is provided.
